# SPECIFICATION FOR A WEBSITE

## Overview

Provide a general summary of the web project. Must include:

* The "problem" your web project is trying to fix.
* The target audience of your web project.

A finance tracking app is a solution to many people's problem of spending money, "splurging", and other bad habits. Seeing their expenses can help avoid such problems. Me and my teammate's website also includes the budjet and income which helps see a person's natural money habits.

The audience that we are targeting is for college or university students. 

## Team

Provide a list of team members. If team members have different roles and/or tasks, then list the roles of each member too.
